# Introduction to Machine Learning
A simple introductory tutorial that covers basic aspects of:
* Classification
* Clustering
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA)

We use the sklearn functions to experiment with different basic techniques.

# Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Networks
Introductory tutorial that covers:
* Perceptron Algorithm and Logistic Regression
* A quantum leap to convolutional neural networks (This tutorial material was kindly prepared by Md Nasir Uddin Laskar https://github.com/nasirml)

We use the Perceptron algorithm and logisitc regression are basic numpy and sklearn, and CNN tutorial uses tensorflow and keras.
